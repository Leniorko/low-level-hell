# Readme

This repo is will be a long story of my journey with C and (probably) game development from scratch.

I'm following handmadehero project from [this youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MollyRocket). But I have different dev enviroment so I'll use different API in future for sure (there is no Win32 API on linux lmao). I will figure out differences somehow and will succeed with this project. I hope I will.

`.vscode` folder contains debugger options for launch main.c
This is the only purpose for now
